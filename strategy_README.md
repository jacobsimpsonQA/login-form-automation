# ðŸ§­ Test Strategy Template â€“ Documentation

## Overview
This document explains how to use the included `test_strategy_template.md` file for structured QA planning.

The strategy template is meant to help QA engineers define:
- What is being tested and why
- Whatâ€™s in and out of scope
- What test types, tools, and environments are involved
- How success will be measured

It provides a reusable structure for test planning across any QA project, from manual exploratory to automation-heavy testing.

## When to Use It
Use this template at the start of any new QA initiative or project. Itâ€™s especially useful when:
- You're working with cross-functional teams
- You want to define priorities and risks early
- You need stakeholder alignment on scope and goals

## How to Customize
You can clone the file or copy its structure into a new `.md` or `.doc` format for project-specific plans. Customize fields like:
- Objective
- Test Types
- Success Criteria
- Risks

## Why Itâ€™s Here
I added this to show that my QA experience goes beyond writing test cases â€” I also think strategically about test coverage, communication, and product quality at a higher level.
